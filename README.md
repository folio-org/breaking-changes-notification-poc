This is a work-in-progress PROOF OF CONCEPT for notifying the community about breaking changes across the project.

Periodically (frequency TBD):
- Look for the `breaking` label on PRs across the organization.
- Pull into a summary report in Google Sheets.
- Post notification of new stuff to a slack channel.

The POC runs as a Google Apps Script attached to a spreadsheet.

Based on a Technical Council discussion on [2024-02-21](https://folio-org.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/TC/pages/43582046/2024-02-21+-+Communicating+Breaking+Changes).
